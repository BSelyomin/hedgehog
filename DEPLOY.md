# Portable deployment

Implementation prepared here: a Node 24 frontend image, backend image, TimescaleDB service, private backend/database network, database health checks, automatic schema migrations and a persistent database volume. No deployment or Docker image build has been verified in this workspace: Docker Desktop WSL integration is unavailable, npm registry DNS fails, and no external service credentials were supplied.

## Run on another machine

1. Install Docker Engine with Compose (or enable Docker Desktop's WSL integration).
2. Copy this repository, including `compose.yaml`, `Dockerfile`, `/web`, `/server`, `/shared` and the root configuration files.
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`. Set API keys privately. Leave DATABASE_URL empty for local TimescaleDB, or set a Tiger Data connection string with its required TLS parameters.
4. Run `docker compose up --build -d`. Open http://localhost:3000.
5. Inspect `docker compose logs backend` for poll completion. Load a portfolio in the browser. Stock histories and tags are collected on startup and by scheduled jobs.
6. Run `docker compose exec backend npm run job -- review-tags`. Review company and macro tags against the real series. Approve individual pairs with `docker compose exec backend npm run job -- approve-tag SERIES TAG`.
7. Finalize `server/seed/sector_tags.json` yourself; rebuild to seed it. Allowed company tickers must first be explicitly added to `server/seed/tags.json`, then rebuild/reseed. Run stock-tags and tag-series jobs as needed.
8. Run `docker compose exec backend npm run job -- backfill`, then measure, summaries and briefings. Run sample-markets and sample-links to obtain values for manual review.

The web app proxies `/api` to the private backend. The browser never calls Kalshi. The backend migrates before it listens and runs the poller every five minutes. AI and voice features stay absent when their credentials or supported source data are unavailable. Price-loading errors do not fabricate histories.

## Validation on a networked machine

```
npm install
npm run lint
npm test
npm run build
docker compose config
docker compose up --build -d
```

Commit the generated package-lock.json after successful installation, and switch the Docker dependency stage to `npm ci` for reproducible dependency resolution. Pin the TimescaleDB image digest after validating its version. The initial image currently resolves documented semver ranges and a moving TimescaleDB tag; it is portable but not bit-for-bit reproducible.

## Back up and transfer the database

```
docker compose exec -T database pg_dump -U hedgehog -Fc hedgehog > hedgehog.dump
```

Restore into a compatible TimescaleDB installation using Timescale's documented pre/post restore procedures. Copying the repository alone does not copy price history, holdings or audio. Protect database dumps as user data. `docker compose down` keeps the volume; `down -v` deletes it.

For public hosting, configure your chosen host, HTTPS reverse proxy and secret store. Set COOKIE_SECURE=true behind HTTPS. No domain registration, cloud resources, public publication or external account creation has occurred. Cloud provider details remain in questions.txt.
